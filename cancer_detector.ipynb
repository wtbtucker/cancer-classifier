    "The data for this competition is a version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset that does not contain duplicates. I obtained the dataset from the Kaggle competition page[3]. The data was provided to Kaggle by Bas Veeling[1], with additional input from Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi, Geert Litjens, and Jeroen van der Laak[2].\n",
