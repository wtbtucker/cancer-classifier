# Introduction

This project seeks to solve the problem of identifying pathological images as cancerous or non-cancerous. Better classification tools could help doctors detect cancer earlier and save patients' lives. 

The data for this competition is a version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset that does not contain duplicates. I obtained the dataset from the Kaggle competition page[3]. The data was provided to Kaggle by Bas Veeling[1], with additional input from Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi, Geert Litjens, and Jeroen van der Laak[2].

The data consists of 96x96 color images extracted from histopathologic scans of lymph node sections. Each image is labelled to reflect the presence of metastatic tissue (cancer). There are 220,025 images in the training dataset
